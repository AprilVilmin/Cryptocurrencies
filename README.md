# Cryptocurrencies and Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Purpose
Martha, your best friend since childhood, works at Accountability Accounting, a firm that is getting ready to make a presentation on cryptocurrency. You have the chance to help Martha with this. You are excited because, both you and Martha want to ‘make a difference’ and see Cryptocurrency as a way to do this. Bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency and because of this the price is higher now, than it was before. But Bitcoin is not the only player in the game. Martha has data available to her that contains information/data on different types of cryptocurrencies. Some of the other cryptocurrencies are more affordable than Bitcoin. You are tasked with delving into the data with Martha, identifying patterns/trends and persuading her company to pursue cryptocurrencies as investments.
